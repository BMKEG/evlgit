Pron: 'Evil Git'. An idea to implement a system of evaluation on GitHub repositories derived from the BIRN community's framework of evaluation for their software projects (which in turn was derived  from the CMMI-DEV 1.3 criteria).

This is currently a pre-pre-alpha project but is worth putting together here in an early form.
